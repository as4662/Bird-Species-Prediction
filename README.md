Predicting bird species is a challenging task that requires the integration of 
ecological knowledge, advanced data analysis techniques, and machine learning 
algorithms. This paper explores the current state of bird species prediction and 
highlights potential future enhancements in the field.
The prediction of bird species involves the analysis of various features, including 
plumage, behavior, habitat, and geographic location. Researchers have leveraged 
advancements in technology, such as high-resolution cameras and bioacoustic 
recording devices, to gather large volumes of data for analysis. Machine learning 
algorithms are then employed to detect patterns and characteristics that 
Future enhancements for bird species prediction include improving data 
collection methods by utilizing advanced sensors and technologies like remote 
sensing and bioacoustics. Integrating multimodal data sources, such as visual, 
acoustic, and environmental variables, can enhance prediction accuracy. The 
application of deep learning techniques, transfer learning, and active learning can 
further improve model performance.
